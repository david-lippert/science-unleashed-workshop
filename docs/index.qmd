Demystify the version control process and learn how to manage and collaborate on coding projects with other researchers and developers. Attendees will become familiar with Git and GitHub.

## Learning Objectives

2. Set up a GitHub repository for version control purposes.
3. Use GitHub Desktop software to manage the code staging and committing process, and to interface with a remote repository on GitHub.
4. Employ Git branching strategies to manage different versions of code.
5. Collaborate with peers by pulling and merging changes from a shared repository.
6. Troubleshoot common Git errors and conflicts during version control.
