# Science Unleashed: Embracing Open Practices Workshop
:::

Learn what open science is, why it is important for research, engineering, and society, and how to apply open practices at GW. During the workshop we will discuss new requirements to make all research outputs publicly available then we will highlight tools, processes, and initiatives available to help you share knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

1. Discuss the importance of open science principles in promoting collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility in research
2. Document federal and global guidance and policies designed to advance open science
3. Highlight tools and resources available at GW to enable our community to excel as we apply open science practices
