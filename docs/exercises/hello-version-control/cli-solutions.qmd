# "Hello Version Control" Command Line Solutions

Here are some of the commands you might use during the course of the version control exercise, if you are using Git from the command line:

Create a GitHub repo (perhaps called "my-first-repo"), obtain its remote address, then clone the repo and navigate there from the command line:

```sh
cd ~/Desktop
git clone REMOTE_ADDRESS # where REMOTE_ADDRESS is the remote address of your GitHub repo
cd my-first-repo/
```

Open the project in the text editor:

```sh
code .
```

Create a file using the text editor (or use the command line):

```sh
touch my_file.md
```

Edit and save the file, then stage the changes and make a local commit:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "My first commit"
```

Push the changes up to GitHub:

```sh
git push origin main

```


Repeat the process of editing and committing and pushing as desired.
