# "Pull Request Workflow" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

Adopt a Pull Request Workflow to collaborate with yourself (on independent projects).

## Instructions

This is a process we will follow to add or revise the contents of our own existing repos:

  1. Choose one of your existing GitHub repos, or create a new one (i.e. the "origin" repo).
  2. Clone the repo locally if you haven't already done so. Ensure your local main branch is up-to-date with the origin main branch.
  3. Checkout a new local feature branch called something like "new-feature-123".
  4. Modify some part of the codebase (for this exercise, any trivial change will do), save your work, and make a commit on the local feature branch.
  5. Push the local feature branch revisions to the origin repo.
  6. Create a Pull Request to compare the feature branch changes against the main branch.
  7. In the Pull Request, review the changes and optionally make some comments.
  8. When you are satisfied with the changes, merge the Pull Request via the GitHub interface.

To repeat the process (after changes have been merged):

  9.  Using your Git Client, checkout the main branch, and pull the most recent changes from the origin main branch.
  10. Then repeat steps 3-8 above.
